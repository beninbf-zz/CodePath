Design - Distribution centers spread across different locations have to be able to
to deliver packages at the lowest cost possible.

The distribution centers have two kinds of trucks. Diesel trucks that have a long
range but are at a high cost, and electric trucks that are at a low cost, but have
a shorter range.

Order for customers must be fufilled within the desired delivery time, 1, 3, or 5 days
AND deliveries must be sent out at the lowest cost.

How to accomplish these things?

Microservices:

- Fufillment Microservice
- Distribution Center Microservice
- Schedule Service
- Location Distance Service

Fufillment Microservice:
- Services as a controller. A request will be made to the fufillment service
for an order to fufilled. It is the Fullfilment services job to pick the correct
disburtion center to assign to the order.
- The Fufillment center knows about ALL of the disribution centers. Based on the
delivery location for an order, the Fufillment service will leverage the location
distance service in order to find a subset of distribution centers of size n.
This subset of distribution centers will have requests made to them. The responses
will be whether or not the distribution centers can honor the order, and if they can
what the cost is, and what date they can honor the delivery.
Based on this repsponse, the fullfillment center will chose the appropriate
distribution center.
- Logical schema: table storing distribution center information

Distribution Center Microservice:
-Each distribution center has all of the information about its capacity, and its inventory. A
request will be made to a distribution center inquiring about the earliest date and cost
that a delivery can be fufilled. The distribution center has all local knowledge regarding
this information
- It leverages the schedule service on its available trucks, to see when trucks are availabile
- It will mark orders as pending, and reserve inventor, (a hold), anticpating that the order
will be fullfilled, unless the distribution centers is informed that it can release the hold.

Logical schema: inventory table, truck table, order table, order item join table

-schedule service; Given a truck returns avaiable dates

- distance service: given the address of an order, returns the nearest disburtion centers
