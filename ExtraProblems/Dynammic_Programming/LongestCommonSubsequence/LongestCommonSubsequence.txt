Longest Common Subsequence



Problem Statement:



Given two strings a and b, find the longest common subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Find such longest subsequence which is common to both a and b. If multiple such subsequences occur, return any one of them and if no such subsequence found then return “-1”.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



There are two arguments, both strings a and b.



Output Format:



Return one string which is the longest common subsequence.



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



The first line in the input contains string a and next line contains string b.



ABCDE

AECBD



Output Format:



A string which is the longest common subsequence.



ABD



Constraints:



1 <= len(a), len(b) <= 400

Characters of string a and string b can be from [a, z], [A, Z] and [0-9].


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



ABCDE

AECBD



Sample Output:



ABD



Explanation:



ABD occurs in both ABCDE and AECBD in the same relative order as the subsequence. There is no other subsequence longer than 3. Also, do note that ACD is also a valid subsequence of length 3, in such cases return any of them.
