Strings Interleave





Problem Statement:

You're given three strings a, b and i. Write a function that checks whether i is an interleaving of a and b.



String i is said to be interleaving string a and b, if:
len(i) = len(a) + len(b).
i only contains characters present in a or b.
i contains all characters of a. From a, any character a[index] should be added exactly once in i.
i contains all characters of b. From b, any character b[index] should be added exactly once in i.
Order of all characters in individual strings (a and b) is preserved.


Input Format:



You will be given three strings a, b and i.



Strings can contain

Small alphabets - a-z
Large alphabets - A-Z
Numbers - 0-9


Output Format:



Return a boolean if i is an interleaving of a and b.



Constraints:



0 <= len(a), len(b) <= 1000

0 <= len(i) <= 2000



Sample Test Case:



Sample Input-1:



a = "123"

b = "456"

i = "123456"



Sample Output-1:



True



Sample Input-2:



a = "AAB"

b = "AAC"

i = "AAAABC"



Sample Output-2:



True



Sample Input-3:



a = "AAB"

b = "AAC"

i = "AAABAC"



Sample Output-3:



True
