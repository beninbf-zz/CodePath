Recursive solution



A function f(start, end) is defined to denote the minimum operations needed for solving the mtxSizes in the range start…end



Thus the base case would be

f(i, i+1) = 0

This is because it is denoting a single matrix.



Lets put a parenthesis at index. We can recur for the cost for start…index and index…end.



cost[index] = mtxSizes[start]*mtxSizes[index]*mtxSizes[end] + f(start, index) + f(index, end)



Recurrence relationship for this problem would be

f(start, end) = min(cost[index])

where start<index<end



Optimal solution



We can memoize the recurrence relationship mentioned above or build an iterative version for the same problem. We can see there are overlapping subproblems.

We can maintain a 2D table of size nxn. Thus every table cell denotes f(i,j).



Space Complexity: O(length(mtxSizes)^2)

Time Complexity: O(length(mtxSizes)^3)
