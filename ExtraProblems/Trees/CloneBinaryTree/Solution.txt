We have provided one solution for this problem. This is the optimal solution.



The problem asks to clone a binary tree. We do it recursively. First we create a new node using the current root node value. We clone the current nodeâ€™s left child and assign as left child of new node. We do the same for right child.



Time complexity:

O(N)



Auxiliary space:

O(N) because of using stack



Space complexity:

Including input, O(N)
