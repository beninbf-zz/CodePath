Alternative Node Split



Problem Statement:



Given a linked list, split it into two such that every other node goes into the new list. For lists with odd number of nodes, first one should be longer. For example: an input list: {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} results in {a, c, e, g} and {b, d, f}.



Input format:

There is only one argument named head denoting the head of the input linked list.



Output format:

Return an array of linked list which contains two linked list.



Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes <= 100000
1 <= values stored in the nodes <= 1000000000
Input will be a singly linked list


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5



Sample Output:



1 -> 3 -> 5

2 -> 4



Explanation:

Process is explained in the problem statement.
