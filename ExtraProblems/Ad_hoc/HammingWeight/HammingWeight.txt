Hamming Weight



Problem Statement:



Hamming Weight of an integer x is defined as the total number of set bits in the binary representation of the integer x. Now, given an array s of n integers. We need to calculate the total hamming weight of the array s i.e. to sum-up the individual hamming weight of each integer in the array S.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



First and only parameter of the function that is to be implemented the array of 64-bit integers s.



Output Format:



The function returns an integer variable storing the value of the total hamming weight of the given input array s.



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



First line of the input contains one single integer n, denoting number of elements in array s.

Next n lines of the input, each line contains single integer denoting the ith element in the array s.



If n = 3 and s = [ 1, 2, 3 ], then custom input format will be:



3

1

2

3



Output Format:



Print one single line containing one integer denoting the total hamming weight of the input array s.

For the above provided custom input, output would be:



4



Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= s[i] < 2^32 where 0 <= i < n.


Sample Test Case:



n = 3

s = [ 1, 2, 3 ]



Sample Output:



4



Explanation:



For the array s = [1, 2, 3], number of set bits for each element of the array is mentioned below:

Binary representation of 1 is “1” so set bits in 1 is 1.

Binary representation of 2 is “10” so set bits in 2 is 1.

Binary representation of 3 is “11” so set bits in 3 are 2.

So, total set bits in 1 + set bits in 2 + set bits in 3 are 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Hence Summing hamming weight of given array [1, 2, 3] is 4.
