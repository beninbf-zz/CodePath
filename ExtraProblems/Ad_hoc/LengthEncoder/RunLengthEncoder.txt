Run Length Encoder



Problem Statement:



Compress a string (only has alphabet characters), with basic encoding, where you simply count the number of repeated characters. Then also write a routine to decompress it.

 

e.g.

Input: "AAAAA" 

Output: "5A"

 

Input: "BAAAB"

Output: "B3AB"

 

Input: "ABAB"

Output: "ABAB" [We are not concerned about characters repeating in groups]

 

Assume that a given character will not repeat more than 127 times.



Input format:



There is only one argument named strInput denoting the input string.



Output format:



Return the compressed string



Constraints:

String consists of alphabetic characters only
1 <= length_of_input_string <= 6500


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input 1:



AAAAA



Sample Output 1:



5A

 

Explanation 1:

 

Character “A” is repeated 5 times consecutively.

 

Sample Input 2:



ABaaaBCC



Sample Output 2:

  

AB3aB2C

 

Explanation 2:

 

Character “a” is repeated 3 times in consecutively, character “C” is repeated 2 times consecutively.
