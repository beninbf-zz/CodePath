Detect Prime Numbers



Problem Statement:



Given an integer array a of size N. For each integer in a we have to check if it is a prime number or not.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



There is only one argument denoting integer array a.



Output Format:



Return a string res of size N, where ith character of string contains '1' if a[i] is a prime number else it should contain '0'. (1 is neither a prime nor a composite number, hence according to the previous statement, it should go in else part, i.e. ith character should contain '0', when a[i] = 1.)



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



The first line should contain a number N, denoting the number of elements in the array a. In next N lines, ith line should contain a number a[i], denoting ith element in a.



If N = 4 and a = [6, 2, 5, 8], then input should be:



4

6

2

5

8



Output Format:



There will be one line, containing a resultant string res.



For input N = 4 and a = [6, 2, 5, 8], output will be:



0110



Constraints:



1 <= a[i] <= 4 * 10^6
1 <= N <= 3 * 10^5


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



[6, 2, 5, 8]



Sample Output:



0110



Explanation:



6 is not a prime number. (6 = 2 * 3)

2 is a prime number.

5 is a prime number.

8 is not a prime number. (8 = 2 * 4)
