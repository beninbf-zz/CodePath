2D Array Search



Problem Statement:



You are given a sorted 2D array arr of size r * c, where all the numbers (integers) in the array are in non decreasing order from left to right and top to bottom. ( i.e. arr[i][j] <= arr[i+1][j] and arr[i][j] <= arr[i][j+1] for all i = 0,1,...,(r - 2) and j = 0,1,...,(c - 2) )



Check if a given number x exists in arr or not.



Given an arr, you have to answer q such queries.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



There are two arguments, arr and x, denoting input 2D array and a number to be searched as mentioned in problem statement respectively



Output Format:



Return string "present" if x is present in arr, string "not present" otherwise.



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



The first line of the input should contain a single integer r, denoting the no. of rows of input array arr. Second line should contain a single integer c, denoting the no. of columns of arr.

In the next r lines, each line should contain c space separated numbers. jth number in ith line of these r lines is arr[i][j], denoting the number at ith row of the jth column of arr.

Next line should contain q, denoting no of queries to be answered. In next q lines, each line should contain xi, denoting x for ith query



If r = 3, c = 4, arr = [[1, 2, 3, 12], [4, 5, 6, 45], [7, 8, 9, 78]], q = 3, x for 1st query = 6, x for 2nd query = 7 and x for 3rd query = 23, then input should be:



3

4

1 2 3 12

4 5 6 45

7 8 9 78

3

6

7

23



Output Format:



There will be q lines, ith line of which contains the result for ith query as "present" or "not present"



For input r = 3, c = 4, arr = [[1, 2, 3, 12], [4, 5, 6, 45], [7, 8, 9, 78]], q = 3, x for 1st query = 6, x for 2nd query = 7 and x for 3rd query = 23, output will be:



present

present

not present



Constraints:



1 <= r <= 10^3
1 <= c <= 10^3
1 <= q <= 10^4
-10^9 <= arr[i][j] <= 10^9, (i = 0,1,...,(r - 1) and j = 0,1,...,(c - 1))
-10^9 <= x <= 10^9


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input 1:



arr = [[1, 2, 3, 12], [4, 5, 6, 45], [7, 8, 9, 78]]

queries = [6, 7, 23]



Sample Output 1:



result = [“present”, “present”, “not present”]



Explanation 1:



Given number x=6 is present at arr[1][2] and x=7 is present at arr[2][0]. Hence, "present" returned for them, while

x=23 is not present in arr, hence "not present" returned



Sample Input 2:



arr = [[3, 4], [5, 10]]

queries = [12, 32]



Sample Output 2:



result = [“not present”, “not present”]



Explanation 2:



Given number x=12 and x=32 are not present in arr. Hence, "not present" returned for both of the queries
