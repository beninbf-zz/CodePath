Minimum Element In A Sorted And Rotated Array



Problem Statement:



You are given a sorted array arr which is rotated by unknown pivot k. You need to find minimum element from given array using fastest possible way which uses only constant space.



Input Format:



Only argument for function, integer array named arr.



Output Format:



Return integer which is minimum element in given array.



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 10^5 where n is number elements in given array.

Every element of array will be unique.

For every element arr[i],

-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 where 0 <= i <= (n-1)



Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



arr = [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3]



Sample Output:



1



Explanation:



For given arr = [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3] which is sorted in ascending order and right rotated by pivot 5 has minimum value as 1 at index 5.
