Divide An Integer By Another Integer



Problem Statement:



Given two integers a and b, you have to find quotient q, when a is divided by b.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



Two integers a and b.



Output Format:



A integer q, denoting quotient of a / b.



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



The first line should contain an integer, denoting a.

Second line should contain an integer, denoting b.



If a = 5 and b = 2, then input should be:



5

2



Output Format:



There will be one line, containing a integer q, denoting quotient value of a / b.



For input a = 5 and b = 2, output will be:



2



Constraints:



-10^18 <= a, b <= 10^18
b != 0
You are not allowed to use division (/) operator.
You are not allowed to use multiplication (*) operator.
You are not allowed to use mod (%) operator.


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



a = 5, b = 2



Sample Output:



2



Notes:



Here we have mentioned explicitly that b != 0, but in interview you should clarify this with the interviewer and handle the case accordingly.



Maximum time allowed in interview: 20 Minutes.
