Sum Zero





Problem Statement:



Given an array of integers arr of size n, find a non-empty subarray resSubArray such that sum of elements in resSubArray is zero.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



There is only one argument, arr denoting input array.



Output Format:



Return an array of integer res of size 2, where res[0] and res[1] denotes start index and end index(0 based indexing) (both inclusive) respectively for resSubArray in arr.



Note that:

If there is no such subarray, then return array res of size one and res[0] = -1.
If there are multiple such subarray, then return indices for any one of them.
If a matching subarray is a subarray of a larger matching subarray, then return indices for either one.
If there is a number '0' in the array arr, then it counts as a valid sum zero subarray.


Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



The first line of the input should contain a single integer n, denoting the size of input array arr.

In the next n lines, ith line should contain an integer denoting arr[i].



If n = 6 and arr = [5, 1, 2, -3, 7, -4], then input should be:



6

5

1

2

-3

7

-4



If n = 5 and arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, -9], then input should be:



5

1

2

3

5

-9



Output Format:



There are two cases here:

1. If a valid sum zero subarray exists in arr, then there will be two lines for output. First line will have an integer res[0] and second line will have an integer res[1], denoting starting index and ending index of required subarray (0 based indexing, both inclusive).

2. Otherwise if there is no valid sum zero subarray, there will be only one line for output, having an integer -1.



For input n = 6 and arr = [5, 1, 2, -3, 7, -4], output will be:



1

3



For input n = 5 and arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, -9], output will be:



-1



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 5*10^5
-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, (i = 0,1,...,(n-1))


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Input 1:



6

5

1

2

-3

7

-4



Sample Output 1:



1

3



Explanation 1:



For given input array arr, arr[1]+arr[2]+arr[3] = 1+2+(-3) = 0. So, subarray starting from index 1 upto index 3 (0 based indexing) is sum zero subarray.

(3,5 and 1,5 are the other correct solutions)



Sample Input 2:



5

1

2

3

5

-9



Sample Output 2:



-1



Explanation 2:



For given input array arr, there is no subarray such that sum of integers in that subarray is 0.

So, -1 is printed as output.
