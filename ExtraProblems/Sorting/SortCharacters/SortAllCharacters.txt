Sort All Characters


Problem Statement:



You have to sort an array of characters containing alphanumeric characters along with some other characters - ‘!’, ’@’, ’#’, ’$’, ’%’, ’^’, ’&’, ’*’, ’(‘, ’)’. You are given a character array named arr.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:

There is only one argument in input, a character array named arr.



Output Format:

Return a character array result, containing characters in sorted order of their ASCII values. You can overwrite the existing array.



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:

The first line contains the size, n, of the character array. Next n lines each contain the characters present in the array, with each character of the array in a new line.



If arr = {a,z,i,#,&,l,c} then input should be:



7

a

z

i

#

&

l

c



Output Format:



Output each character of the array on a new line, in sorted order of their ASCII values.



For above input - arr = {a,z,i,#,&,l,c}, output will be:



#

&

a

c

i

l

z



Constraints:

1 <= length(arr) <= 100000


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



10

a

s

d

f

g

*

&

!

z

y



Sample Output:



!

&

*

a

d

f

g

s

y

z



Explanation:

Ascii values of the characters present in the character array are:

a: 97, s: 115, d: 100, f: 102, g: 103, *: 42, &: 38, !: 33, z: 122, y: 121.

Now sorting them according to their ascii values results in the given output.
