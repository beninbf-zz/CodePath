Nearest Neighbours



Problem Statement:



Given a point p, and other n points in two-dimensional space, find k points out of n points which are nearest to p.

NOTE: Distance between two points is measured by the standard Euclidean method.



Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



There are 4 arguments in input, an integer p_x, which is the x coordinate of point p, integer p_y, which is the y coordinate of point p, an integer k and a 2D integer array of points n_points.



Output Format:



Return a 2D integer array result, which contains k points, nearest to point p.



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



The first line of input contains x coordinate of point p, p_x. The next line contains y coordinate of point p, p_y. The next line contains integer k. The next line contains the number of rows n in array points and the following line contains c, the number of columns in array points. It is guaranteed that c = 2 always. The following n lines contain 2 integers each, the x and y coordinates of a point.



Example:



0

0

2

3

2

1 1

0 1

1 0



Output Format:



Output k lines, each line contains two integers each representing x and y coordinates.



For the above input, the output will be:


0 1

1 0



Constraints:



1 <= n <= 100000
-1000000000 <= coordinates of the points <=1000000000
k <= total number of points in array points.


Sample Test Cases:



Sample Test Case 1:



Sample Input 1:



1

1

1

2

2

0 0

1 0



Sample Output 1:



1 0



Explanation 1:



The distance of point {0,0} from point p{1,1} is sqrt(2) and that of point {1,0} is 1. We need to choose 1(k) point having the minimum distance from point p. So it is {1,0}.


Sample Test Case 2:



Sample Input 2:



1

1

2

3

2

1 0

2 1

0 1



Sample Output 2:



1 0

2 1



Explanation 2:



Here, we can see that there are all the points are at the same distance from point p. So the answer can be any 2 points. Here {{1,0},{0,1}} and {{2,1},{0,1}} are equally acceptable answers.
