Idea to solve the problem is:

1) First reverse the whole string.

2) Then reverse the individual words.



For example if input is:



s = "Have a nice day!"



1) Then first reverse the whole string, 

s = "!yad ecin a evaH"



2) Then reverse the individual words,

s = "day! nice a Have"



Now have a look at the solution provided by us.



Time Complexity:

O(n).

The first pass over the string is obviously O(n/2) = O(n). The second pass is O(n + combined length of all words / 2) = O(n + n/2) = O(n), which makes this an O(n) algorithm.



Auxiliary Space used:

O(1).



Space Complexity:

O(n).

As space complexity includes the input size also and we have a string in input of length n.



Note that generally we use Auxiliary Space Used = Space Complexity, but there is a different. Auxiliary space does not count the input size but space complexity does.
