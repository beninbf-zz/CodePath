Given a text string t of length n and a pattern string p of length m, return start indices of all occurrences of p in t.



A naive approach would be iterate over all possible substrings of text t having length m and compare it with pattern p.

As there are total (n-m+1) such substrings, each of length m, total no of comparisons would be O(n*m)

An optimal approach would be as follows:



KMP (Knuth Morris Pratt) Pattern Matching Algorithm



The Naive pattern searching algorithm doesn’t work well in many cases as we slide the pattern by one and compare all

characters at each shift untill we find a mismatch.

Following are some examples.



t = "CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCB"

p = "CCCCCB"



t = "CDCDCDECDCDCDECDCDCDE"

p = "CDCDCE"



The basic idea behind KMP’s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after one or more matches), we already know

some of the characters are going to match in the text of next window. We take advantage of this information to avoid

matching the characters that we know will anyway match and thus avoiding redundant comparisons.



Example:

t = "CCCCCDCCCDC"

p = "CCCC"



We compare first window of text t with pattern p: (i.e. starting with 1st char of t)

t = "CCCCCDCCCDC"

p = "CCCC"  [Initial position]

We find a match. This is same as naive algorithm.



In the next step, we compare next window of t with p (i.e. starting with 2nd char of t)

t = "CCCCCDCCCDC"

p =  "CCCC" (Pattern shifted one position)

This is where KMP does optimization over naive. In this second window, we only compare 4th A of pattern with 4th

character of current window of text to decide whether current window matches or not. Since we know first three

characters will anyway match, we skipped matching first three characters.



How to know how many characters to be skipped?

To know this, we pre-process pattern and prepare an integer array lps[] that tells us the count of characters to be

skipped. To be precise, lps[i] = x shows that if first un-matched character is found at (i+1)th char of p, then for

next comparison, you can skip first x chars of p.



Preprocessing:



KMP algorithm preprocesses p[] and constructs an auxiliary array lps[] of size m (same as size of pattern) which is

used to skip characters while matching.

Name lps indicates longest proper prefix which is also suffix. A proper prefix is prefix with whole string not allowed.

For example, prefixes of “ABC” are “”, “A”, “AB” and “ABC”. Proper prefixes are “”, “A” and “AB”.

Suffixes of the string are “”, “C”, “BC” and “ABC”.

For each substring p[0..i] where i = 0 to m-1, lps[i] stores length of the maximum matching proper prefix which is

also a suffix of the substring pat[0..i].

 lps[i] = the longest proper prefix of pat[0..i]

            which is also a suffix of pat[0..i].

Note : lps[i] could also be defined as longest prefix which is also proper suffix. We need to use "proper" at atleast

one place to make sure that the whole string is not considered.



Examples of lps[] construction:

For the pattern “CCCC”,

lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 3]



For the pattern “CDEFG”,

lps[] is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]



For the pCttern “CCDCCECCDCC”,

lps[] is [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



For the pCttern “CCCDCCCCCD”,

lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]



For the pCttern “CCCDCCC”,

lps[] is [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]



To build lps array, for lps[i], we keep track of the length of the longest proper prefix suffix value for the previous

index(let call it 'len'). We initialize lps[0] and len as 0. If p[len] and p[i] matches, we increment len by 1 and

assign the incremented value to lps[i]. If p[i] and p[len] do not match and len is not 0, we update len to lps[len-1].

See the implementation for better understanding.



We use a value from lps[] to decide the next characters to be matched. As mentioned before, the idea is to not match a

character that we know will anyway match.



How to use lps[] to know a number of characters to be skipped?



We start comparison of p[j] with j = 0 with characters of current window of text.

We keep matching characters t[i] and p[j] and keep incrementing i and j while pat[j] and txt[i] keep matching.

When we see a mismatch, we know that characters p[0,1,..,j-1] match with t[i-j,..,i-1]

(Note that j starts with 0 and increment it only when there is a match).

We also know that lps[j-1] is count of characters of p[0,1,..,j-1] that are both proper prefix and suffix.

From above two points, we can conclude that we do not need to match these lps[j-1] characters with txt[i-j,..,i-1]

because we know that these characters will anyway match.



See the implementation for better understanding.
