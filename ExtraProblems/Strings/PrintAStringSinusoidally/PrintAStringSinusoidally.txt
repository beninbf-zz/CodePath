Print A String Sinusoidally



Problem Statement:



[This is just a stupid problem, that has no relation to anything else. It's there primarily because we see it on and off. It's a string puzzle disguised as a programming problem]

 

Also called "SnakeString". For example, the phrase "Google Worked" should be printed as follows (where ~ is the word separator):

 

    o     ~         k

  o  g  e  W   r   e

G     l        o       d



Input format:



There is only one argument named s denoting the input string.



Output format:



Print the string in sinusoidally. Format is:

→ There will be 3 rows

→ Print ~ for spaces

→ First character is printed in 1st column of 3rd row

→ Second character is printed in 2nd column of 2nd row

→ Third character is printed in 3rd column of 1st row

→ Fourth character is printed in 4th column of 2nd row

→ Fifth character is printed in 5th column of 3rd row

→ Sixth character is printed in 6th column of 2nd row

→ This process goes on…



Constraints:

String consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces
3 <= length_of_input_string <= 10000


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input:



Google Worked



Sample Output:

  

    o     ~         k

  o  g  e  W   r   e

G     l        o       d
