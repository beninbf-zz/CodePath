We have provided only optimal solution for this problem. There are few observations:

→ i’th character of input string is placed in i’th column of a row.

→ 0th index character of string is placed in 3rd row. Then 4th, 8th and go on.

→ 1st index character of string is placed in 2nd row. Then 3rd, 5th and go on.

→ 2nd index character of string is placed in 1st row. Then 6th, 10th and go on.

So, we can construct 3 string representing 3 rows using the above information.


Time complexity:

O(N)



Auxiliary space:

O(3*N) because of a 2D array



Space complexity:

Including input, O(3*N).
