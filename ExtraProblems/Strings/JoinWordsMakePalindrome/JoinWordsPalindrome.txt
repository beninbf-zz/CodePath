Join Words To Make A Palindrome



Problem Statement:



Given a list of strings words, of size n, check if there is any pair of words, that can be joined (in any order) to form a palindrome then return the pair of words forming palindrome.



Input Format:



Only argument for function, list of strings words.



Output Format:



Return a pair of words (i.e. list of string result of size 2 such that result[0] + result[1] is a palindrome).

In case of multiple answer return any one of them.

In case of no answer return list [“NOTFOUND”, “DNUOFTON”].



Constraints:



Length l for each word of words list, 1<= l <= 30.

Size of list words n, 2 <= n <= 20000.

Characters for each word can be from [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9].



Sample Test Case:



Sample Input 1:



words = [ “bat”, “tab”, “zebra” ]



Sample Output 1:



result = [ “bat”, “tab” ]



Explanation 1:



As “bat” + “tab” = “battab”, which is a palindrome.



Sample Input 2:



words = [ “ant”, “dog”, “monkey” ]



Sample Output 2:



result = [ “NOTFOUND”, “DNUOFTON” ]



Explanation 2:



As for each 6 combinations of string of words, there is no single generated word which is a palindrome hence result list will be [ “NOTFOUND”, “DNUOFTON” ].
